Project 

1. flow of code with resources 
2. flow of code communication with various modules
3. how to handle functionality with in module 



1. Requirment gathering
   - Understand the problem to be solved.
   - Identify user needs and expectations.
   - Document functional and non-functional requirements.

2. design priciples
  - domain driven design
  - SOLID principles
  - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  
3. functanlity 
   - Complex data 
   - marry feature goroutine channel 
   - error handling
   - logging and monitoring
   - complex 1million records

4. optimisation
   - your code DSA 
   - profiling and benchmarking
   - memory management
   - concurrency patterns

5. resources 
  - compex data handling 
  - i/o operations
  - network communication
  - database interaction
  Indexing strategies

Replication modes

Connection pooling

- Mysql 
- Postgresql
- Mongodb
- Redis
- Kafka
- RabbitMQ

6. benchmarking and testing
   - unit testing
   - integration testing
   - performance testing
   - load testing
   - stress testing
   - code coverage analysis
   - continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)

7. distrubted system 

- how does it impact your distrubted system
- data consistency
- fault tolerance
- scalability
- network latency
- distributed tracing and monitoring
